5,"@cburniske Ah, only the metrics that confirm your bias matter. The metrics that show Ethereum is losing popularity don't count?

That seems weird. Developers seem to love the cheaper fees and faster throughputs of the other smart contract platforms :)",2021-05-25 21:56:40,APompliano
6,"@cburniske I deleted it because I felt it was a distraction and an unfair fight for you, but since you bring it up....this is what Polygon literally has on their homepage about Ethereum 😉 https://t.co/oqeCI285iq",2021-05-25 21:54:21,APompliano
7,"@cburniske To be clear, we probably agree on more than we both realize.

Bitcoin is focused on decentralization as #1 pursuit.

Ethereum is trying to out innovate, but it will face constant new innovators who create cheaper/faster/etc.

Co-existence is likely. We can all get along :)",2021-05-25 21:46:41,APompliano
8,"@cburniske Why are you dodging the topic of ethereum not being the #1 smart contract platform any more?

Doesn’t BSC have faster throughput and cheaper fees? Or we not supposed to discuss the slow tech of ethereum in comparison to faster block times? 😉

11,"@cburniske Glad we agree that bitcoin is by far the most popular DeFi product today.

Also, why is Binance smart chain 2x more popular and Matic just as popular as ethereum?

You speak of Ethereum as if it is the winner, but on chain data suggests it is #2 or #3 smart contract platform 🤷🏽‍♂️",2021-05-25 21:26:18,APompliano
12,@cburniske So you’re admitting that bitcoin is the most popular DeFi product today and simply betting that this fact will change in the future?,2021-05-25 21:18:04,APompliano
